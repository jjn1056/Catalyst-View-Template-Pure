=head1 NAME

Catalyst::View::Template::Pure - Catalyst view adaptor for Template::Pure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package  MyApp::View::Story;

    use Moose;
    use HTTP::Status qw(:constants);

    extends 'Catalyst::View::Template::Pure';

    has [qw/title body timestamp/] => (is=>'ro', required=>1);

    sub current { scalar localtime }

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      timestamp => scalar(localtime),
      returns_status => [HTTP_OK],
      init_time => scalar(localtime),
      template => q[
        <!doctype html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <title>Title Goes Here</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <div id="main">Content goes here!</div>
            <div id="current">Current Localtime: </div>
            <div id="timestamp">Server Started on: </div>
          </body>
        </html>      
      ],
      directives => [
        'title' => 'title',
        '#main' => 'body',
        '#current+' => 'current',
        '#timestamp+' => 'timestamp',
      ],
    );

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable

Create a controller that uses this view:

    package MyApp::Controller::Story;

    use Moose;
    use MooseX::MethodAttributes;

    extends 'Catalyst::Controller';

    sub display_story :Local Args(0) {
      my ($self, $c) = @_;
      $c->view('Story',
        title => 'A Dark and Stormy Night...',
        body => 'It was a dark and stormy night. Suddenly...',
      )->http_ok;
    }

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable

When hitting a page that activates the 'display_story' action, returns:

      <!doctype html>
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <title>A Dark and Stormy Night...</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <div id="main">It was a dark and stormy night. Suddenly...</div>
          <div id="current">Current Localtime: July 29, 2016 11:30:34</div>
          <div id="timestamp">Server Started on: July 29, 2016 11:30:00</div>
        </body>
      </html>

(Obviously the 'localtime' information will vary ;)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Catalyst::View::Template::Pure> is an adaptor for L<Template::Pure> for the L<Catalyst>
web development framework.  L<Template::Pure> is an HTML templating system that fully
separates concerns between markup (the HTML), transformations on that markup (called
'directives') and data that the directives use on the template to return a document.

I highly recommend you review the documentation for L<Template::Pure> if you wish to gain a
deeper understanding of how this all works.  The following information is specific to how
we adapt L<Template::Pure> to run under L<Catalyst>; as a result it will assume you already
know the basics of creating templates and directives using L<Template::Pure>

B<NOTE>: Like L<Template::Pure> I consider this work to be early access and reserve the
right to make changes needed to achieve stability and production quality.  In general I feel
pretty good about the interface but there's likely to be changes around speed optimization,
error reporting and in particular web components are not fully baked.  I recommend if you
are using this to avoid deeply hooking into internals since that stuff is most likely to
change.  If you are using this for your work please let me know how its going.  Don't find bugs
surprising, but please report them!

=head1 CREATING AND USING VIEWS

In many template adaptors for L<Catalyst> you create a single 'View' which is a sort of
factory that processes a whole bunch of templates (typically files in a directory under
$APPHOME/root).  Variables are passed to the view view the Catalyst stash.  Choosing the
template to process is typically via some convention based on the action path and/or via
a special stash key.

This system works fine to a point, but I've often found when a system gets complex (think
dozens of controllers and possible hundreds of templates) it gets messy.  Because the
stash is not strongly typed you have no declared interface between the view and your
controller.  This can be great for rapid development but a long term maintainance nightmare.
People often lose track of what is and isnt' in the stash for a given template (not to
mention the fact that a small typo will 'break' the interface between the stash and the
view template.

L<Catalyst::View::Template::Pure> is a bit different.  Instead of a single template
factory view, you need to make a view subclass per resource (that is, for each HTML
webpage you want to display).  Additionally you will make a view for any of the
reusable bits that often make up a complex website, such as includes and master page
layouts.  That sounds like a lot of views, and will seem wierd to you at first if you
are used to the old style 'one view class to rule the all'.  The requirement to make a
new View subclass for each page or part of a page does add a bit of overhead to the
development process.  The upside is that you are creating strongly types views that
can contain their own logic, defaults and anything else that can go into a Perl class.
This way you can enforce an interface between your views and the controllers that use
them.  Over time the extra, original overhead should pay you back in less maintainance
issues and in greater code clarity.

So here's the example!  Lets create a simple view:

    package  MyApp::View::Hello;

    use Moose;
    use HTTP::Status qw(:constants);

    extends 'Catalyst::View::Template::Pure';

    has [qw/title name/] => (is=>'ro', required=>1);

    sub timestamp { scalar localtime }

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      template => q[
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Title Goes Here</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <p>Hello <span id='name'>NAME</span>!<p>
            <p>This page was generated on: </p>
          </body>
        </html>      
      ],
      directives => [
        'title' => 'title',
        '#name' => 'name',
        '#timestamp+' => 'timestamp',
      ],
      returns_status => [HTTP_OK],
    );

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

So this is a small view with just three bits of data that is used to create
an end result webpage.  Two fields need to be passed to the view (title and name)
while the third one (timestamp) is generated locally by the view itself.  The three
entries under the 'directives' key are instructions to L<Template::Pure> to run
an action at a particular CSS match in the templates HTML DOM (see documentation
for L<Template::Pure> for more details). 

B<NOTE> In this and most following examples the template is a literal string inside
the view under the C<template> configuration key. This is handy for demo and for 
small views (such as includes) but your template authors may prefer to use a more standard
text file, in which case you can specify a path to the template via configuration options
C<template_src> or C<auto_template_src>; see L</CONFIGURATION>
  
Lets use this in a controller:

    package MyApp::Controller::Hello;

    use Moose;
    use MooseX::MethodAttributes;

    extends 'Catalyst::Controller';

    sub say_hello :Path('') Args(0) {
      my ($self, $c) = @_;
      $c->view('Hello',
        title => 'Hello to You!',
        name => 'John Napiorkowski',
      )->http_ok;
    }

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

Again, if you are following a classic pattern in L<Catalyst> you might be using the
L<Catalyst::Action::RenderView> on a global 'end' action (typically in your
Root controller) to do the job of forwarding the request to a view.  Then, the view
would decide on a template based on a few factors, such as the calling action's
private name.  With L<Catalyst::View::Template::Pure> instead we are calling the view directly,
as well as directly sending the view's arguments call to the view, instead of via the
stash (although as we will see later, you can still use the stash and even the
L<Catalyst::Action::RenderView> approach if that is really the best setup for
your application).

B<NOTE> An important distinction here to remember is that when you pass arguments to
the view, those arguments are not passed directly as data to the underlying
L<Template::Pure> object.  Rather these arguments are combined with any local or global
configuration and used as arguments when calling ->new on the actual view component.
So arguments passed, even via the stash, as not directly exposed to the template, but
rather mediated via the actual view object. Only attributes and methods on the view
object are exposed to the template.

In calling the view this way you setup a stronger association between your controller
and the view.  This can add a lot of clarity to your code when you have very large
and complex websites.  In addition the view returned is scoped 'Per Request', instead
of 'Per Application' like most common Catalyst views in use.  'Per Request' in this
case means that the first time you call for the view in a given request, we create
a new instance of that view from the arguments passed.  Subsequent calls to the same
view will return the same instance created earlier.  This can be very useful if you
have complex chained actions and wish to add information to a view over the course
of a number of actions in the chain.  However when the response is finalized and
returned to the client, the current request goes out of scope which triggers DESTROY
on the view.

Another useful thing about the fact that the view is scoped 'Per Request' is that
it contains a reference to the context.  So in your custom view methods you can call
$self->ctx and get the context to do stuff like build links or even access models.
Just keep in mind you need to think carefully about what logic is proper to the
view and which is proper to the controller.  In general if there is logic that
would be the same if the resource generated by the view was a different type (say
JSON or XML) then its likely that logic belongs in the controller.  However I
encourage you to choose the approach that leads to clean and reusable code.

Lastly, L<Catalyst::View::Template::Pure> allows you to specify the type of response
status code can be associated with this view.  This can be useful when you want
to make it clear that a given view is an error response or for created resources.
To enable this feature you simple set the 'returns_status' configuration key to
an arrayref of the HTTP status codes allowed.  This is simple a number (201 for
created, for example) but for clarity in the given example I've used L<HTTP::Status>
to give the allowed codes a friendly name.  You can choose to follow this example
or not!  As a futher timesaver, when you set allowed statuses, we will inject into
your view some helper methods to set the desired status.  As in the given example:

    $c->view('Hello',
      title => 'Hello to You!',
      name => 'John Napiorkowski',
    )->http_ok;

We are setting $c->res->status(200).  For people that prefer the actual code numbers
there is also ->http_200 injected if you are better with the number codes instead of
the friendly names but I recommend you choose one or the other approach for your project!

Please keep in mind that calling ->http_ok (or any of the helper methods) does not
immediately finalize your response.  If you want to immediately finalize the
response (say for example you are returning an error and want to stop processing the
remaining actions) you will need to $c->detach like normal.  To make this a little
easier you can chain off the response helper like so:

    $c->view('NotFound')
      ->http_404
      ->detach;

Sending a request that hits the 'say_hello' action would result in:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Hello to You!</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>Hello <span id='name'>John Napiorkowski</span>!<p>
        <p>This page was generated on: Tue Aug  2 09:17:48 2016</p>
      </body>
    </html>  

(Of course the timestamp will vary based on when you run the code, this
was the result I got only at the time of writing this document).

=head1 USING THE STASH

If you are used to using the L<Catalyst> stash to pass information to your view
or you have complex chaining and like to build up data over many actions into the
stash, you may continue to do that.  For example:

    sub say_hello :Path('') Args(0) {
      my ($self, $c) = @_;
      $c->stash(
        title => 'Hello to You!',
        name => 'John Napiorkowski',
      );
      $c->view('Hello')->http_ok;
    }

Would be the functional equal to the earlier example.  However as noted those
arguments are not passed directly to the template as data, but rather passed as
initialization arguments to the ->new method when calling the view the first time
in a request.  So you may still use the stash, but because the view is mediating
the stash data I believe we mitigate some of the stash's downsides (such as a lack
of strong typing, missing defined interface and issues with typos, for example).

=head1 CHAINING TEMPLATE TRANFORMATIONS

There are several ways to decompose your repeated or options template transforms
into reusable chunks, at the View level.  Please see L<Template::Pure> for more
abour includes, wrappers and overlays.  However there are often cases when the
decision to use or apply changes to your template best occur at the controller
level.  For example you may wish to add some messaging to your template if a form
has incorrect data.  In those cases you may apply additional Views.  Applied views
will use as its starting template the results of the previous view.  For example:

    sub process_form :POST Path('') Args(0) {
      my ($self, $c) = @_;
      my $v = $c->view('Login');

      if($c->model('Form')->is_valid) {
        $v->http_ok;
      } else {
        $v->apply('IncorrectLogin')
          ->http_bad_request
          ->detach;
      }
    }

You may chain as many applied views as you like, even using this technique to build up
an entire page of results.  Chaining transformations this way can help you to avoid some
of the messy, complex logic that often creeps into our templates.

=head1 MAPPING TEMPLATE ARGS FROM AN OBJECT

Generally you send arguments to the View via the stash or via arguments on the view
call itself.  This might sometimes lead to highly verbose calls:

    sub user :Path Args(1) {
      my ($self, $c, $id) = @_:
      my $user = $c->model('Schema::User')->find($id) ||
        $c->view('NoUser')->http_bad_request->detach;

      $c->view('UserProfile',
        name => $user->name,
        age => $user->age,
        location => $user->location,
        ...,
      );
    }

Listing each argument has the advantage of clarity but the verbosity can be distracting
and waste programmer time.  So, in the case where a source object provides an interface
which is identical to the interface required by the view, you may just pass the object
and we will map required attributes for the view from method named on the object.  For
example:

    sub user :Path Args(1) {
      my ($self, $c, $id) = @_:
      my $user = $c->model('Schema::User')->find($id) ||
        $c->view('NoUser')->http_bad_request
          ->detach;

      $c->view(UserProfile => $user)
        ->http_ok;
    }

It is up to you to decide if this is creating too much structual binding between your
view and its model.  You may or may not find it a useful convention.

=head1 COMMON VIEW TASKS

The following are suggestions regarding some of the more common tasks we need to
use a view for.  Most of this is covered in L<Template::Pure> in greater detail,
but I wanted to show the minor 'twists' the Catalyst adaptor presents.  Please
keep in mind the following are not the only ways to solve this problems, but just
what I think of as very straightfoward ways that are a good starting point for you
as you climb the learning curve with L<Template::Pure>

=head2 Includes, Wrappers and Master Pages

Generally when building a website you will break up common elements of the user
interface into re-usable chunks.  For example its common to have some standard
elements for headers and footers, or to have a master page template that provides
a common page structure.  L<Template::Pure> supports these via processing
instructions which appear inside the actual template or via the including of
actual template objects as values for you directive actions on in your data.

The documentation for L<Template::Pure> covers these concepts and approaches in
general.  However L<Catalyst::View::Template::Pure> provides a bit of assistance
with helper methods that are unique to this module and require explanation.  Here's
an example of an include which creates a time stamp element in your page:

    package  MyApp::View::Include;

    use Moose;

    extends 'Catalyst::View::Template::Pure';

    sub now { scalar localtime }

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      template => q{
        <div class="timestamp">The Time is now: </div>
      },
      directives => [
        '.timestamp' => 'now'
      ],
    );

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

Since this include is not intended to be used 'stand alone' we didn't bother to
set a 'returns_status' configuration.

So there's a few ways to use this in a template.

    package  MyApp::View::Hello;

    use Moose;
    use HTTP::Status qw(:constants);

    extends 'Catalyst::View::Template::Pure';

    has 'name' => (is=>'ro', required=>1);

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      returns_status => [HTTP_OK],
      template => q{
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Hello</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <p id='hello'>Hello There </p>
            <?pure-include src='Views.Include'?>
          </body>
        </html>
      },
      directives => [
        '#hello' => 'name',
      ],
    );

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

In this example we set the C<src> attribute for the include processing
instruction to a path off 'Views' which is a special method on the view that
returns access to all the other views that are loaded.  So essentially any
view could serve as a source.

The same approach would be used to set overlays and wrappers via processing
instructions.

If using the C<Views> helper seems too flimsy an interface, you may instead
specify a view via an accessor, just like any other data.

    package  MyApp::View::Hello;

    use Moose;
    use HTTP::Status qw(:constants);

    extends 'Catalyst::View::Template::Pure';

    has 'name' => (is=>'ro', required=>1);

    sub include {
      my $self = shift;
      $self->ctx->view('Include');
    }

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      returns_status => [HTTP_OK],
      template => q{
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Hello</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <p id='hello'>Hello There </p>
            <?pure-include src='include' ?>
          </body>
        </html>
      },
      directives => [
        '#hello' => 'name',
      ],
    );

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

Just remember if your include expects arguments (and most will) you should pass
them in the view call.

In fact you could allow one to pass the view C<src> include (or wrapper, or overlay)
from the controller, if you need more dynamic control:

    package  MyApp::View::Hello;

    use Moose;
    use HTTP::Status qw(:constants);

    extends 'Catalyst::View::Template::Pure';

    has 'name' => (is=>'ro', required=>1);
    has 'include' => (is=>'ro', required=>1);

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      returns_status => [HTTP_OK],
      template => q{
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Hello</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <p id='hello'>Hello There </p>
            <?pure-include src='include' ?>
          </body>
        </html>
      },
      directives => [
        '#hello' => 'name',
      ],
    );

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

    package MyApp::Controller::Hello;

    use Moose;
    use MooseX::Attributes;

    extends 'Catalyst::Controller';

    sub hello :Path('') {
      my ($self, $ctx) = @_;
      $ctx->view('Hello',
        name => 'John',
        include => $ctx->view('Include'));
    }

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

Even more fancy approaches could include setting up the required bits via
dependency injection (approaches for this in Catalyst are still somewhat
experimental, see L<Catalyst::Plugin::MapComponentDependencies>

=head1 METHODS

This class defines the following methods.  Please note that response helpers
will be generated as well (http_ok, http_200, etc.) based on the contents of
your L<\returns_status> configuration settings.

=head2 apply

Takes a view name and optionally arguments that are passed to ->new.  Used to
apply a view over the results of a previous one, allowing for chained views.
For example:

    $c->view('Base', %args)
      ->apply('Sidebar', items => \@menu_items)
      ->apply('Footer', copyright => 2016)
      ->http_ok;

When a view is used via 'apply', the result of the previous template becomes
the 'template' argument, even if that view defined its own template via
configuration.  This is so that you can use the same view as standalone or as
part of a chain of transformations.

Useful when you are building up a view over a number of actions in a chain or
when you need to programmatically control how a view is created from the
controller.  You may also consider the use of includes and overlays inside your
view, or custom directive actions for more complex view building.

=head2 wrap

Used to pass the response on a template to another template, via a 'content'
argument. Similar to the 'wrapper' processing instruction.  Example:

    package MyApp::View::Users;

    use Moose;

    extends 'Catalyst::View::Template::Pure';

    has [qw/name age location/] => (is=>'ro', required=>1);

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      returns_status => [200],
      template => q[
        <dl>
          <dt>Name</dt>
          <dd id='name'></dd>
          <dt>Age</dt>
          <dd id='age'></dd>
          <dt>Location</dt>
          <dd id='location'></dd>
        </dl>
      ],
      directives => [
        '#name' => 'name',
        '#age' => 'age',
        '#location' => 'location',
      ]
    );

    package MyApp::View::HeaderFooter;

    use Moose;

    extends 'Catalyst::View::Template::Pure';

    has 'title' => (is=>'ro', isa=>'String');
    has 'content' => (is=>'ro');

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      returns_status => [200],
      template => q[
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>TITLE GOES HERE</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            CONTENT GOES HERE
          </body>
        </html>
      ],
      directives => [
        title => 'title',
        body => 'content',
      ]
    );

    package MyApp::Controller::UserProfile;

    use Moose;
    use MooseX::MethodAttributes;

    extends 'Catalyst::Controller';

    sub show_profile :Path('profile') Args(0) {
      my ($self, $c) = @_;
      $c->view('UserProfile', $user)
        ->wrap('HeaderFooter', title=>'User Profile')
        ->http_ok;
    }

Generates a response like (assuming C<$user> is an object that provides
C<name>, C<age> and C<location> with the sample values):

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>User Profile</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <dl>
          <dt>Name</dt>
          <dd id='name'>Mike Smith</dd>
          <dt>Age</dt>
          <dd id='age'>42</dd>
          <dt>Location</dt>
          <dd id='location'>UK</dd>
        </dl>
      </body>
    </html>

=head2 response

Used to run the directives and actions on the template, setting information
into the L<Catalyst::Response> object such as body, status, headers, etc.
Example

    $c->view('Hello',
      title => 'Hello There',
      list => \@users )
      ->response(200, %headers);

This will populate the L<Catalyst::Response> status and headers, and render the
template into body.  It will not finalized and send the response to the client.
If you need to stop processing immediately (for example you are creating some
sort of error response in a middle action in a chain) you need to $c->detach
or use the detach convenience method:

    $c->view('BadRequest',
      title => 'Hello There',
      list => \@users )
      ->response(400, %headers)
      ->detach;

Often you will instead set the L</returns_status> configuration setting and
use a response helper instead of using it directly.

    $c->view('BadRequest',
      title => 'Hello There',
      list => \@users )
      ->http_bad_request
      ->detach;

=head2 $response helpers

In order to better purpose your views and to add some ease of use for your
programmers, you may specify what HTTP status codes a view is allowed to
return via the L</returns_status> configuration option.  When you do this
we automatically generate response helper methods.  For example if you set
C<returns_status> to [200,400] we will create methods C<http_ok>, C<http_200>,
C<http_bad_request> and C<http_400> into your view.  This method will finalize
your response as well as return an object that you can call C<detach> upon
should you wish to short circuit any remaining actions.

Lastly you may pass as arguments an array of HTTP headers:

    $c->view("NewUser")
      ->http_created(location=>$url)
      ->detach;

=head2 ctx

Lets your view access the current context object.  Useful in a custom view method
when you need to access other models or context information.  You should however
take care to consider if you might not be better off accessing this via the controller
and passing the information into the view.

    sub include {
      my $self = shift;
      $self->ctx->view('Include');
    }

=head1 COMPONENTS

B<WARNING> Components are the most experimental aspect of L<Template::Pure>!

Example Component View Class:

    package  MyApp::View::Timestamp;

    use Moose;
    use DateTime;

    extends 'Catalyst::View::Template::Pure';

    has 'tz' => (is=>'ro', predicate=>'has_tz');

    sub time {
      my ($self) = @_;
      my $now = DateTime->now();
      $now->set_time_zone($self->tz)
        if $self->has_tz;
      return $now;
    }

    __PACKAGE__->config(
      pure_class => 'Template::Pure::Component',
      auto_template_src => 1,
      directives => [
        '.timestamp' => 'time',
      ],
    );
    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

And the associated template:

    <pure-component>
      <style>
        .timestamp {
          background:blue;
        }
      </style>
      <script>
        function alertit() {
          alert(1);
        }
      </script>
      <span class='timestamp' onclick='alertit()'>time</span>
    </pure-component>

Usage in a view:

    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Title Goes Here</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="main">Content goes here!</div>
        <pure-timestamp tz='America/Chicago' />
      </body>
    </html>

A component is very similar to an include or even a wrapper that you might
insert with a processing instruction or via one of the other standard methods
as decribed in L<Template::Pure>.  The main difference is that components can
bundle a style and scripting component, and components are aware of themselves
in a hierarchy (for example if a component wraps other components, those inner
components have the outer one as a 'parent'.

Given the experimental nature of this feature, I'm going to leave it underdocumented
and let you look at the source and tests for now.  I'll add more when the shape of
this feature is more apparent after usage.

=head1 RUNTIME HOOKS

This class defines the following method hooks you may optionally defined in your
view subclass in order to control or otherwise influence how the view works.

=head2 $class->modify_init_args($app, $args)

Runs when C<COMPONENT> is called during C<setup_components>.  This gets a reference
to the merged arguments from all configuration.  You should return this reference
after modification.

=head2 $self->modify_context_args($ctx, $args)

Runs at C<ACCEPT_CONTEXT> and can be used to modify the arguments (including those passed to the view) before they are used to create a response.  Should return C<$args>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This Catalyst Component supports the following configuation

=head2 template

This is a string which is an HTML Template.

=head2 template_src

Filesystem path where a template can be found

=head2 auto_template_src

Loads the template from a filesystem path based on the View name.  For example if
your view is "MyApp::View::Story", under $home/MyApp/View/Story.pm then you'd
expect a template at $home/MyApp/View/story.html

This feature is evolving and may change as the software stablizes and we get feedback
from users (I know the current default location here is differnt from the way a lot
of common Catalyst Views work...)

=head2 returns_status

An ArrayRef of HTTP status codes used to provide response helpers.

=head2 directives

An ArrayRef of match => actions that is used by L<Template::Pure> to apply tranformations
onto a template from a given data reference.

=head2 filters

    filters => {
      custom_filter => sub {
        my ($template, $data, @args) = @_;
        # Do something with the $data, possible using @args
        # to control what that does
        return $data;
      },
    },

A hashref of information that is passed directly to L<Template::Pure> to be used as data
filters.  See L<Template::Pure/Filters>.

=head2 pure_class

The class used to create an instance of L<Template::Pure>.  Defaults to 'Template::Pure'.
You can change this if you create a custom subclass of L<Template::Pure> to use as your
default template.

=head1 ALSO SEE

L<Catalyst>, L<Template::Pure>.

L<Template::Pure> is based on a client side Javascript templating system, 'pure.js'.  See
L<https://beebole.com/pure/> for more information.
